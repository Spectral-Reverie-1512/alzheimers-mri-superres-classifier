# alzheimers-mri-superres-classifier
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to perform super-resolution and denoising of noisy MRI scans, followed by a deep neural network classifier (ResNet-18) to predict dementia stages. Includes preprocessing scripts, model training, and an interactive Gradio-based web interface for inference.
